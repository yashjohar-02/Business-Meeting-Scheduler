# Business-Meeting-Scheduler
This project develops a Business Meeting Scheduler that allows users to schedule meetings, validate inputs, avoid time and participant conflicts, support online/offline modes, and store meeting details. The final phase includes visual analysis using Matplotlib to display meeting trends and insights.
